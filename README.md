## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the MNIST Digit Recognition project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-digit-recognition.git
    cd mnist-digit-recognition
    ```

    This command clones the project repository to your machine and navigates to the project directory.

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command installs all the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file. These dependencies include Python 3.x, TensorFlow, Keras, and Matplotlib.

    **Note:** It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with existing Python packages. If you don't have `pip` installed, you can install it following the instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

3. **Explore the Project:**

    Now that you have cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, you are ready to explore the project. The main components include the Jupyter Notebook `Bootcamp.ipynb`, which is used for training the neural network on the MNIST dataset.

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Bootcamp.ipynb
    ```

    Open the notebook in a compatible environment (e.g., Google Colab, Jupyter) and follow the instructions to train the model.

4. **Training the Model:**

    Within the Jupyter Notebook, execute the provided Python code cells to load and preprocess the MNIST dataset, build and train the neural network, and save the trained model as `mnist_model.h5`.

5. **Testing the Model:**

    After training, you can use the trained model for testing by following the instructions in the "Testing the Model" section of the README. This involves loading the model in a separate notebook or script and making predictions on test images.

By following these steps, you'll have the MNIST Digit Recognition project set up on your local machine, ready for exploration and use.

## Outcome

After training the neural network on the MNIST dataset, you can observe the model's performance and make predictions on new test images. Below is an example of the project outcome:
